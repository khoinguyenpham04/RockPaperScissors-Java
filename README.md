# RockPaperScissors-Java

This project implements a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game in Java. I created this project out of boredom and wanted just a bit of practice with Java for the COMP16421 Exam.

Features:
- User plays against the computer.
- User chooses between Rock, Paper, and Scissors.
- Computer randomly selects its choice.
- Winner (user or computer) or a tie is declared.
